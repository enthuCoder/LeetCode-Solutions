LeetCode Problems and their Solutions in Swift Programming Language

Each solution is added in a self contained Swift file for easier organization.

In my opinion, sometimes it is better to experiment in an XCode commandline project rather than a Playground as you can use breakpoints.
During implentation, if you need to experiment on your understanding of swift concepts, you can use "PlayaroundWithConcepts.swift" file.
